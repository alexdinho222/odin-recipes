            <h1>Beef Wellington</h1>

            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>
                To be completely honest, I do not know much about this dish. I believe the dish to be British,
                but it is entirely possible that this is not the case at all. I had a friend tell me about 
                them once and I've found myself dreaming about them ever since. As you can see from the 
                picture, it seems to be some rather rare done piece of beef enclosed in some kind of breading.
                The whole ordeal seems to be some sort of a magic trick. How could one so neatly fit a slab
                of beef into what seems to be a perfectly uninterrupted slice of bread. You certainly will not
                see me complaining about it though!
            </p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>2 1/2 pounds beef tenderloin</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>2 ounces liver pate</li>
                <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
                <li>1 (17.5 ounce) package frozen puff pastry</li>
                <li>1 egg yolk, beaten</li>
                <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can beef broth</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons red wine</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place beef in a small baking dish, and
                    spread with 2 tablespoons softened butter. Bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until
                    browned. Remove from pan, and allow to cool completely. Reserve pan juices.
                </li>
                
                <li>
                    Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. Saute onion and mushrooms
                    in butter for 5 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool. 
                </li>

                <li>
                    Mix together pate and 2 tablespoons softened butter, and season with salt and
                    pepper. Spread pate over beef. Top with onion and mushroom mixture.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Roll out the puff pastry dough, and place beef in the center. Fold up, and seal all the
                    edges, making sure the seams are not too thick. Place beef in a 9x13 inch baking dish,
                    cut a few slits in the top of the dough, and brush with egg yolk.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Bake at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 425 degrees
                    F (220 degrees C) for 10 to 15 more minutes, or until pastry is a rich, golden brown.
                    Set aside, and keep warm.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Place all reserved juices in a small saucepan over high heat. Stir in beef stock and red
                    wine; boil for 10 to 15 minutes, or until slightly reduced. Strain, and serve with beef.
