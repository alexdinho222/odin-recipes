    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Beef Vindaloo is a <em>tasty</em> dish. It does not have to be made
        with beef. In fact, I have seen it made with <strong>fish</strong>,
        <strong>chicken</strong>, <strong>lamb</strong>, and <strong>goat</strong>.
        This dish comes from the <em>Goa</em> region of India and packs quite
        a punch where spice is concerned. If you have the time, and enough water,
        I highly recommend you try this dish!
